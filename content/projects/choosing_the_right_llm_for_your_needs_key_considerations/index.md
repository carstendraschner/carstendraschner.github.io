Consider the key factors when selecting a Large Language Model (LLM) for your project.
  
<!-- excerpt -->

## Key Considerations

* Benchmark Performance
* License
* Model Size
* Alignment



### Benchmark Performance

* Consider the model's performance on relevant benchmarks known from Open LLM Leaderboard and especially Arena Elo.

### License

* Ensure the license aligns with your project's requirements and complies with any regulatory restrictions.

### Model Size

* Consider the trade-off between model size and performance for your specific use case.

### Alignment

* Evaluate the alignment process and whether it's transparent, as this can impact the model's performance and reliability.

### Transparency of Training

* Look for models with transparent training data and methods to ensure you understand how the model was trained.

### Inference Costs

* Assess the model's inference costs and consider the trade-off between performance and cost.

### Context Size

* Consider the model's context size and whether it's suitable for your specific use case.

### Compatibility

* Evaluate whether the model is compatible with SOTA libraries like transformers and whether it's easily integrable into your workflow.

### Scaling Efficiency

* Assess the model's scaling efficiency or e.g. it has full quadratic complexity with more input tokens.

### Multilingualism

* Evaluate the model's multilingual capabilities it's effect for your specific use case.

## What Do You Think?

* What is your importance-order of LLM features you look at? Which criteria do you miss in this list or which should be ranked higher?
* Within our Projects Comma Soft AG these are some of the major criteria we look at when we are selecting GenAI models like LLMs.
