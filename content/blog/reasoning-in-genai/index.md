Exploring the current state of reasoning in GenAI, the challenges faced, and potential approaches to achieving true reasoning capabilities.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Reasoning is a Key Ability to Transform AI into AGI

* In Reflection AI, reasoning has been unmasked.
* OpenAIs GPT-o1 behavior could be reproduced by silent chain-of-thought (CoT) with other models.
* Reasoning is still more of a marketing promise than an actual capability.
* For example, we observe significant weaknesses in simple tasks.
* Simple multiplication is still a challenge for many models.
* As long as these fundamental issues remain unresolved, we are far from achieving true reasoning capabilities.

## Why I Believe LLMs Should Be Able to Learn Math and Reasoning

* There are varying opinions on whether reasoning is achievable with current AI.
* I am fundamentally optimistic, although I acknowledge the recent criticisms from Yann LeCun and older from Emily M. Bender.
* I have outlined my vision for reasoning in the comments section.

## How to Teach Math Skills as a First Step

* Let's focus on multiplication as a starting point.
* Generate pairs of numbers of different sizes.
* Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets.
* Train a language model (LLM) using a tokenizer that only includes numbers 0-9, 'x' for multiplication, and 'EOS' for the end of the sequence.
* Evaluate which model size yields the best results on the test set.

## What Do You Think?

* Could such an experimental setup help evaluate the computational skills of LLMs/transformer architectures?
* Do you agree that tokens representing individual numbers are crucial for computation, rather than embedding multiple digits like "007" in a single token?
* Have any of you tried something similar, or would you like to collaborate on this research project?
