Exploring Evolutionary Algorithms as an alternative to GenAI for problem-solving, using a fun 2D vehicle race example.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- There is hype around GenAI and LLMs
- Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offer an alternative
- A fun example of EAs using a 2D vehicle race
- Steps involved in EAs explained

<!-- excerpt -->

## Background ‚ò∫Ô∏è

- Within the field of AI is a GenAI and LLM Hype
- These are not always the best approach to solve a problem!
- There are interesting algorithms optimizing their behavior entirely differently: e.g., Evolutionary Algorithms (EA).
- Today I want to show you a fun EA introduction based on a 2D vehicle race "problem"

## Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) explained üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

### Problem üèÅ:
- What is the best vehicle configuration to drive over a 2D surface?

### Vehicle Configuration = Genome üß¨:
- Shape
- Wheel size
- Wheel position
- Wheel weight
- Chassis weight

### Key EA Steps on the vehicle race example üî¢ :
1) **Initialization**: Generate a set of vehicles with random characteristics (genome) called population
2) **Fitness Evaluation**: Check how far they have got on the randomly generated surface.
3) **Selection**: Select a subset of the best vehicles from the population to reproduce and form the next generation, e.g., by tournament selection or rank selection.
4) **Crossover (Recombination)**: Combine the genetic information of two or more selected vehicles to create new offspring. E.g., average two good car genomes or randomly select the information of each...
5) **Mutation**: Randomly modify the genetic information of some individuals in the population to introduce new variations and prevent convergence to a local optimum.
6) **Replacement**: Replace the least performing vehicles with new offspring generated through crossover and mutation.
7) **Termination**: Repeat until a stopping criterion is met: the needed distance, number of iterations, or convergence threshold.
8) **Output**: best vehicle, representing the near-optimal solution

## My Perspective ü§ó:

- Be aware that there are a multitude of possible algorithms to use
- We at Comma Soft AG do not trust any hype and select the appropriate algorithms for the respective problem

## Credit ‚ù§Ô∏è

- To the development team of the interactive EA vehicle race
- I'd also like to thank Hajira Jabeen and Jens Lehmann for their great support in my MT project where I worked on EA and KG for the creation of novel recipes

## Questions

- How would you solve this "race" problem? EA, GenAI, RL, ...?
- Do you want to see more non-GenAI content?
- Have you ever used EA to solve a problem?
