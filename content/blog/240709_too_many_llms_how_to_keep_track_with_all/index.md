Navigating the complex landscape of GenAI models can be challenging, but it's crucial to understand the foundational and finetuned models to make informed decisions.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- The GenAI landscape is crowded with many models
- Keeping track of innovations and true effects is hard
- Transparency issues with many so-called "open-source" models
- Recommendations for navigating this landscape

<!-- excerpt -->

## The current LLM landscape ü§ñ

- Big GenAI LLM competition
- Lots of proprietary and open-source models
- Many Competitors: Big players like Google, Meta, and Microsoft; rising companies like Mistral and OpenAI, but also smaller institutions with foundation models or finetuned models
- Several release their model parameters openly on platforms like Huggingface
- Number of GenAI models are 500k+ (HF total), 60k+ (HF text generation)

## Challenges with number of LLMs ü§Ø

- Difficult to keep track with so many models
- Most innovations are only documented with blog posts or arxiv papers
- True innovations and effects are barely reported
- Model leaderboards are flooded with finetuned models
- Not always clear which and why model architecture and training data are combined

## My problem with current landscape ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Many claim to provide open-source models but do not disclose how those are constructed. What are the true training data and initial training datasets for pretuning, instruction tuning, and alignment?
- Which training hyperparameter setup was used and why
- Why does a specific model have exactly this combination of parameters like: number transformer layers, number heads, hidden-size, intermediate size

## My recommendation ü§ó

- Keep calm and check what is the true source foundation model
- Understand the architecture: e.g. more or less all of those are autoregressive Decoder-Only multilayer transformer networks
- Some introduce a novel architecture ideas like MoE (Mixture of Experts)
- Do your research, demystify LLM-landscape, and implement benchmarks you trust as we do @Comma Soft AG!
