Exploring the nuances of AI ethics across different AI/ML fields and handling internet-based training data responsibly.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- AI ethics principles across different AI/ML fields
- Personal background and perspective on AI ethics
- Recommendations and further reading on AI ethics
- Questions to ponder on AI ethics practices

<!-- excerpt -->

## My Background and Perspective üë∂

- AI ethics is always the same. No matter if GenAI, Computer Vision, or Knowledge Graph-based ML!
- In recent years, I had three main focus areas in the field of AI: My Ph.D. passion in Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning, before a focus on computer vision, and most recently GenAI with a focus on text
- It was always important for me to take a holistic approach. This includes ethical and sustainability aspects in particular.
- In our paper on Ethical and Sustainability Implications for Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning, we have elaborated on topics I also recently found in the literature on LLM AI Ethics [1,2].
- I see a chance that AI areas majorly align in the AI Ethics dimensions, so we can easily learn from each other and share best practices

## Recommendation üëçüèΩ

- At this point, I recommend a well-known but still very valid paper as an introduction to LLM ethics for those who may not yet know it or are new to the field: On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? by Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, Shmargaret Shmitchell [1]

## Further Reading üìñ

- [1] On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? [https://lnkd.in/eGt_UYci](https://lnkd.in/eGt_UYci)
- [2] Ethical and Sustainability Considerations for Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning [https://lnkd.in/eJjATkTQ](https://lnkd.in/eJjATkTQ)

I hope that all those who develop such powerful tools are aware of their responsibility, especially in the context of dual-use, to use their skills in a reflective manner.

## What is your perspective? ü§î

- Do you see differences in the overarching AI Ethics depending on the AI field?
- What are your preferred AI Ethics Survey Papers?
- Where do you consider AI Ethics in your daily R&D AI work?
- What real issues could arise in ML models through the Wikipedia Chuck Norris fact (see image)?

I appreciate having a GenAI R&D team Comma Soft AG that is aware of the AI ethical implications of our work.
