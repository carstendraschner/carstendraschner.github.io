## Trip to PyCon üöÖ

With my great colleagues, Dr. Laura Maa√üen and Sebastian Sch√∂nnenbeck, from our Data Science and GenAI R&D teams, we are excited to attend PyConDE & PyData Berlin.

## Great Talks üé§

We attended so many inspiring and insightful talks in the fields of Machine Learning, MLOps, GenAI, LLM, AI Ethics, and open-source software development.

## My Take ü§ó

- I greatly appreciate the efforts of the open-source development community!
- Having all these open-source tools and freely available tech education is such a privilege!
- I am so glad to be in a field where so much great material is accessible online for free.
- At conferences like PyCon, you meet the people behind the projects, understand their challenges, and get inspired by their motivation that drives their efforts.

## Credit ‚ù§Ô∏è

- To all the Open Source Developers for their efforts in creating so many great and helpful tools.
- To all the open education supporters who create great material accessible to those eager to learn.
- To the PyCon Organising Team and all the Volunteers making this event possible.
- Thanks to Comma Soft AG for investing in R&D and funding us this trip with the opportunity to learn, discuss, and get inspired.
- And finally, thanks to Laura and Sebastian who supported me during the conference ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π. I needed help after knee surgery being at PyCon on crutches and equipped with a knee brace (sports can be dangerous üòâ).
