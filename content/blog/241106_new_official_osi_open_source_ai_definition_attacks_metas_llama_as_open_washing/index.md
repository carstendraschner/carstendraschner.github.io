We getting closer what should be considered being open source in GenAI and not only open weight.

**TL;DR 📝**
- Official OSI definition of Open Source AI available.
- Meta doesn't like it 🙅‍♂️.
- State-of-the-art (SOTA) models lack being truly Open Source 🤔.
- "Open Washing" Problem of Meta and others?!

<!-- excerpt -->

## OSI Definition 📜
- Publicly accessible training data 📊.
- Publicly accessible code for creation 💻.
- Transparent model weights ⚖️.
- Permissive licensing for usage and modification 📝.

## My Take 🤔
- I mostly agree with the definition of Open Source Initiative (OSI) Open Source AI 👍.
- I hope more SOTA models like LLAMA of Meta would follow this definition when claiming they are Open Source 🤞.
- There is Open Washing out there, either in title (like OpenAI) or in claiming models are open source but not reproducible (training data and sampling and creation pipeline) 🚫.
- I still appreciate that more and more non-fully open source models are available and are at least Open Weight SOTA GenAI models.
