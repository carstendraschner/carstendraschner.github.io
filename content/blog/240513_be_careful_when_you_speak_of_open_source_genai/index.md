Examining the implications of using the term "Open" in the context of GenAI by organizations like OpenAI and Meta.

**TL;DR üöÖ**
- Open Source is a huge and important field in computer science and AI
- The word "Open" is used widely within the GenAI field: OpenAI, Open Source LLMs

<!-- excerpt -->

## Background of term open in OpenAI and Open (Source) LLMs üßëüèΩ‚Äçüè´

- Open source libraries accelerate and improve the IT field including GenAI
- Many GenAI models are available on model hubs like Hugging Face
- Often those models like Meta LLAMA-3 are called open-source LLMs
- OpenAI provides the most successful LLM GPT4
- OpenAI does not release their model weights or creation details openly
- Elon Musk being a former founder of OpenAI sued them (maybe also cause of other reasons) for being less open than initially founded for

## Why OpenAI and Meta think it is okay to use the term "Open" ü§ì

- Sam Altman CEO of OpenAI claims in an interview that "Open" is valid as ChatGPT made GenAI/LLMs accessible to the world openly
- Meta claims open source as their LLM LLAMA-3 weights are freely downloadable

## Issues üòì

- No one could reproduce OpenAI or Meta's Models, so they are not open-source
- This missing open source and open research is an issue for reproducibility, fairness, security, democratization of tech, and environmental impact

## My Take (IMHO) ü§ó

- OpenAI can take credit for the hype around LLM-based GenAI as they truly opened access to this tool through a (partial) free open chat interface.
- Most impactful models on HuggingFace like Meta's LLAMA-3 should be considered being OPEN WEIGHT and not open source. Also, there are sometimes issues with its licenses: [https://lnkd.in/dtStQSdn](https://lnkd.in/dtStQSdn)
- Truly open source would mean code can entirely reproduce the models
- Still, these open-weight models accelerate GenAI/LLM developments

## Questions? ü§î

- How do you see the possible confusion of the word "open" initially coming from open-source in GenAI efforts of OpenAI and Meta LLAMA-3 open-weight model?
- Do you use any truly open-source LLM?
