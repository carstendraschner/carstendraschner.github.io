Exploring the ethical considerations and expectations surrounding the values and norms embedded in GenAI chat assistants.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- LLMs generate text based on training
- Alignment and finetuning influence behavior
- Ethical considerations in different languages
- Need for a holistic view on model behavior

<!-- excerpt -->

## Background Information ü§ì

- LLMs are GenAI models that generate texts
- The text-generating behavior is based on the LLM's training
- Chat LLMs are trained in three phases
- Pretuning on large (filtered) text corpora
- Finetuning on, for example, instruction tuning data
- Final alignment to encourage preferred responses

## Some classic methods for adapting LLM behavior üëÆüèº

- Filter certain content, for example, NSFW, from the pretuning data
- Try to induce certain behaviors that we consider appropriate through alignment
- Craft system prompts in which we try to give the Chat Agent specific character traits

## Possible Issues ü´£

- Would you expect different values and norms depending on the language in which you are prompting? Apart from alignment, culture and language may correlate with each other in the respective token spaces even in pretraining.
- Do LLMs map all languages and the values they contain into different or the same space?
- When using LLMs, we should not only pay attention to the performance of the models but also to the behavior (in other languages and token spaces)
- Does alignment-finetuning in one language resolve subjectively problematic behavior in other prompt languages?
- Who should decide about norms and values embedded within GenAI approaches? And do you check those details when selecting a pretuned model?
