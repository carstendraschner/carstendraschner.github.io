Where do those model sizes come from?... My findings!

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- Open-source LLM alternatives to AIaaS
- Hugging Face as a source for open-source models
- Many models are finetuned variants
- Bigger models imply slower inference & higher costs
- Different use cases require different model capabilities
- Questioning the parameter step sizes of models

<!-- excerpt -->

## Background üìù

- As an alternative to AIaaS like ChatGPT, you can interact with LLMs based on open-source models.
- A good source for open-source models is the Hugging Face model library.
- Many models are finetuned variants of existing models like the Meta LLAMA-2 is available as 7B, 13B, 70B.
- Inference runs faster on GPUs like NVIDIA V/A/H100.
- Bigger models: slower inference & have higher (environmental) costs while bigger LLMs mostly outperform smaller models in benchmark-tasks.
- Within multiple use cases, I select the best fitting OS model at @Comma Soft AG use cases.
- Different use cases request different model capabilities including model ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù or inference speed.
- I was wondering why many models follow the parameter ‚Äústep sizes‚Äù 7B, 13B, and 70B.

## My Findings üîç

- Many models are finetuned versions of LLAMA-2 as this was a high-performing open-source LLM available within a ‚Äúmostly‚Äù attractive OS license.
- In most cases, model finetuning does not change the number of parameters.
- LLAMA paper states it provides LLMs: [...] "that achieve the best possible performance at various inference budgets" [...]
- Common hardware is 16GB or 80GB of VRAM. Usually, you have one or two of those GPUs within a system.
- Models are by default available as 16bit representation which leads to 2byte per parameter.
- To run a model, you need space for parameters and a bit remaining for your batch. So 7B fits on 1x 16GB GPU, 13B fits on 2x 16GB GPUs, (the Lab-leaked LLAMA-1 with 35B fits on 1x 80GB GPU) and the 70B LLAMA-2 model runs on 2x 80GB GPUs.

## IMHO ü§ó

- I am looking forward to how 4bit quantization like GPTQ or AWQ changes the model sizes as you might also fit a roughly 145B quantized model on a single A100 with 80GB.
- Some use cases might need fewer model parameters but bigger batches, longer max context length, or faster inference which means fewer parameters or fewer deep networks.
- Consider smaller models especially because of the environmental costs if performance is sufficient.
- I am wondering if there is a true reason for how the parameters are combined within the architecture, the numbers partially feel randomly picked like 80 transformer layers for LLAMA-2 70B vs 40 of 13B version.

## Questions ü§î

- What is your preferred model(-family)?
- Do you use your models as plain or quantized versions?
- Do you think the model architectures of finetuned context window, hidden size, intermediate size, number heads, and transformer layers are well chosen that build the total needed VRAM volume?
