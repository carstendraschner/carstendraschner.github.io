The AI community is abuzz with debates over the efficacy of large versus small language models. Both have their own merits and limitations.

<!-- excerpt -->

## ‚ú® The AI community is buzzing with discussions about model sizes:

- Massive models like Mistral (8x22B), LLAMA3 (400B), and Grok (314B) are turning heads.
- Smaller yet mighty models like Phi 3, LLAMA3 (8B), and Nemo (12B) are proving their worth.

## üîç Key insights:

- Smaller models can compete by focusing on smarter training and pre-tuning methods.
- Benchmarks are helpful but not flawless in measuring a model's value.
- The mystery remains: why might a model with 61 transformer layers outperform one with 60?
- Balancing model architecture is crucial due to the increasing complexity as models scale up.

## üîÆ Future predictions:

- Will we see a standard model size emerge, or will there be a variety for different model size clusters for different platforms (mobile, single GPU, multi-GPU clusters)?
