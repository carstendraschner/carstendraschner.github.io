Brainstorming how old regulations meet new GenAI opportunities.

![Image 1](/img/blog_images/1729692469090.jpeg)

**TL;DR 📝**
- Debate over new regulations restricting text content of public broadcasters online.
- Reform could impact news portals like tagesschau.de by limiting text content to only that which accompanies broadcasts.
- GenAI could potentially auto-generate videos from text content to comply with regulations.
- Questions about the impact and regulation of GenAI in public broadcasting contexts.

<!-- excerpt -->

**Disclaimer**
- I am wondering if my proposed solution would contradict the possible upcoming regulations (see below) 🤔.
- I might be biased as tagesschau.de is for me one good source of news with a mix of text and video while being free of ads 📰(IMHO).
- I am writing this as only one example where old regulations might clash with or ignore recent GenAI developments.

**Current Debate:**
- More or less every household needs to pay ~18€ monthly for public broadcast 💶.
- State premiers are discussing a reform that would significantly restrict the text content of public broadcasters like ARD and ZDF online 📄.
- The draft reform mandates that only texts accompanying broadcasts are permitted, meaning text content can only be published if it has been previously covered in a TV broadcast 📺.
- This change would greatly impact the speed and diversity of reporting, particularly for news portals like tagesschau.de, they say 🚫.
- Private publishers, viewing this as a competitive advantage, support the reform, while public broadcaster representatives warn of negative effects on media diversity and information provision 🏢.

**My GenAI Perspective:**
- What would happen if these platforms autogenerate videos on some digital video stream platform based on the text content they propose? 🤖.
- We have seen such approaches of text-to-video generation or speech synthesis 📝.
- Maybe with a digital clone of some professional or artificial speaker (who needs to allow this for sure and should get paid for giving away the digital twin) 🗣️.
- Currently we face several conflicts of old media and GenAI but this is more between public broadcast and private publishers ⚖️.

**Questions:**
- How do you see it? 🤷.
- Do you think GenAI content would solve their issue? 🤔.
- How is it regulated within your country if public broadcast can write articles? 🌍.
