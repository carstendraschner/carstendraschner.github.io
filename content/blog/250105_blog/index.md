**TL;DR ⏱️**
- New blog live at carstendraschner.github.io
- Reach broader audience beyond LinkedIn
- Experiment with Alan.de and GitHub Pages

<!-- excerpt -->

## Why did I create this website/blog?
📖 Reach a broader audience who may not be on LinkedIn or is annoyed by it  
🙅🏼‍♀️ Overcome the limitations of LinkedIn's algorithm and advertising noise/trackers  
🤖 Experiment and showcase how Alan.de by Comma Soft AG can support me a non web developer to migrate my Blog content in a coding domain I am not used to  

## How did I build it?
🤑 Using GitHub Pages as a completely free hosting solution including acceptable domain  
👨🏼‍💻 Leveraging Eleventy for responsive design/dark mode... with the help of my great friend (and astonishing developer) Konstantin Tieber ❤️ Thank you 🙏🏽  

## What can you find on my blog?
📚 More detailed versions of my Blog posts you have seen here  
🛠️ Past projects and experiments and research papers  
📰 A work-in-progress collection of my GenAI content  

## Where do you prefer to consume and share content?
What are your preferred platforms to store and consume blogposts and AI knowledge? e.g. Bluesky Social, Medium, Towards Data Science, Reddit, Inc., X, Hugging Face Blog, Mastodon, arXiv, ResearchGate, RSS...

Take a look and let me know what features you'd like to see next or where I should publish those content as well. Might take time as I do this in my spare free time 😅

Thanks to all my readers for your kind feedback and support in the DMs❤️! It is really valuable for me to see who is actually reading what and how it benefits you 🥰
