<!-- excerpt -->

## 🧠 AI and Consciousness 🧠

Joscha Bach from Liquid AI presented on how advancements in AI could potentially redefine our understanding of consciousness. My open question for him is: How does he intend to reliably measure the achievement of AI consciousness in his efforts?

## 👩🏻‍🔬 Scientific Chemical Hands on how to fix energy transition 👩🏻‍🔬

As chairman of Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Robert Schlögl delivered an impressively passionate presentation on energy tech for the climate transition and the phasing out of fossil fuels. Besides scientific derivations, he also highlighted significant regulatory issues that hinder successful implementation. I wonder: How these regulations came about, why they are justified if they are (potentially) not scientifically tenable, and how they can now be resolved?

## 🇪🇺 Efficient Distributed Chip Technologies from the heart of Europe 🇪🇺

Christian Mayr from Technische Universität Dresden discussed the potential and developments possible in Dresden. He mentioned the use of clustered chip technologies to operate LLMs. One of my open questions is: How can LLMs be distributed across tens of thousands of chips while still achieving acceptable inferential latencies?

## 📰 GenAI in Media, Opportunities and Risks 📰

In further discussions with Sibylle Anderl from ZEIT Verlagsgruppe, we explored the potentials and risks of Generative AI in text, image, and video generation, and how reducing anonymity could potentially restore credibility. My open question: Whether there is a reliable way to recognize these outputs, given that word frequency alone might not be a proof?

## 🕹️ Metaverse, not only a Playground? 🕹️

Nico Michels from Siemens presented the potentials of the Metaverse and digital twins. Q: I'd love to see how such models can help even small municipalities with climate adaptation models, regional impact assessments, and improvement options?

The open questions highlight the stimulating topics the diverse guests who aim to drive positive change with a progressive mindset. I would like to thank Comma Soft AG and everyone involved for organizing this fantastic event, especially Stephan Huthmacher, whose heartfelt dedication makes this recurring, inspiring event possible. ❤️
