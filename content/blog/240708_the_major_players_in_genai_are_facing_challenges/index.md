**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- GenAI has immense capabilities
- Ethical and secure GenAI pipelines are crucial
- 37C3 presentation on security issues and exploitations
- Categories of threats and challenges in GenAI

<!-- excerpt -->

## Introduction üìñ

GenAI has immense capabilities and can support a variety of processes. As developers, we have the responsibility to build ethical and secure GenAI pipelines. A noteworthy but easily overlooked presentation at the 37C3 event highlighted how tools from leading companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google have been exploited through "Indirect Prompt Injections".

## Threat Categories ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Model Issues: Bias, offensive/dangerous responses, hallucinations, backdoored models.
- User as the attacker: Direct Prompt Injection, Print/Overwrite System Instructions Do-Anything-Now, Denial of Service.
- Indirect Prompt Injections: AI Injection, Scams, Data Exfiltration, Plugin Request Forgery.

## Challenges üí™üèº

The development of security and safeguards for GenAI is still a "work in progress" and consists of various components üëÆüèº
- Alignment is a fine-tuning approach aimed at training model behaviors to respond securely to critical prompts. Learn more here: [https://lnkd.in/eWS-VZCD](https://lnkd.in/eWS-VZCD)
- In Image GenAI, for instance, you can use a post-processing content filter. Check out this peculiar content filter behavior here: [https://lnkd.in/eRaX9JuT](https://lnkd.in/eRaX9JuT)
- An interesting set of additional threats and potential countermeasures were recently presented at the 37C3 event, focusing on Indirect Prompt Injections.
