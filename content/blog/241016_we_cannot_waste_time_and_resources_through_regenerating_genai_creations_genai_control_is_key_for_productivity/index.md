We will see more and more precise adjustment options in GenAI Tooling

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- GenAI often lacks precise Adjuments
- Tools and Models start CLosing the Gap
- Major Waste of Time and Resources through inefficient Regenerates

<!-- excerpt -->

## Control and hallucinations in generated videos:
Generative AI that looks nice, I‚Äôm wondering if the camera turns multiple laps around the guy in the forest, if the color of the jacket on the back would stay the same without having it explicitly described. What do you think, what would happen? üìπüß•

## Importance of GenAI control:
I think overall the opportunity to control generations by precise prompts or other interfaces to further specify intermediate results will be insanely important if these technologies should be adapted in a high efficient outcome-oriented business. We cannot waste time for prompts and regenerates! Cause of time and energy üå±‚è∞
