**TL;DR ⏱️**
- Benchmark Performance
- License
- Model Size
- Alignment

<!-- excerpt -->

## Key Considerations:

- 📊 **Benchmark Performance:** Consider the model's performance on relevant benchmarks known from Open LLM Leaderboard and especially Arena Elo. [https://lnkd.in/eSkeAUV7](https://lnkd.in/eSkeAUV7)
- 📜 **License:** Ensure the license aligns with your project's requirements and complies with any regulatory restrictions. [https://lnkd.in/e8V-eMCh](https://lnkd.in/e8V-eMCh)
- 📊 **Model Size:** Consider the trade-off between model size and performance for your specific use case. [https://lnkd.in/egZt7BmJ](https://lnkd.in/egZt7BmJ)
- 🔄 **Alignment:** Evaluate the alignment process and whether it's transparent, as this can impact the model's performance and reliability. [https://lnkd.in/eViiEyqp](https://lnkd.in/eViiEyqp)
- 🔍 **Transparency of Training:** Look for models with transparent training data and methods to ensure you understand how the model was trained.
- 💸 **Inference Costs:** Assess the model's inference costs and consider the trade-off between performance and cost. [https://lnkd.in/etSajZZc](https://lnkd.in/etSajZZc)
- 📚 **Context Size:** Consider the model's context size and whether it's suitable for your specific use case.
- 🤝 **Compatibility:** Evaluate whether the model is compatible with SOTA libraries like transformers and whether it's easily integrable into your workflow.
- 📈 **Scaling Efficiency:** Assess the model's scaling efficiency or e.g. it has full quadratic complexity with more input tokens.
- 🌎 **Multilingualism:** Evaluate the model's multilingual capabilities it's effect for your specific use case. [https://lnkd.in/eeVsG99M](https://lnkd.in/eeVsG99M)

## What Do You Think?

- What is your importance-order of LLM features you look at? Which criteria do you miss in this list or which should be ranked higher?
- Within our Projects Comma Soft AG these are some of the major criteria we look at when we are selecting GenAI models like LLMs.
