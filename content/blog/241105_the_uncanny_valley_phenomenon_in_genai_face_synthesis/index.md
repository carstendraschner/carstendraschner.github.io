**TL;DR 📝**
- Official OSI definition of Open Source AI available.
- Meta doesn't like it 🙅‍♂️.
- State-of-the-art (SOTA) models lack being truly Open Source 🤔.
- "Open Washing" Problem of Meta and others?!

<!-- excerpt -->

## What Is The Uncanny Valley?
- The uncanny valley is a phenomenon where human-like objects or characters that are almost, but not quite, indistinguishable from real humans can evoke a sense of eeriness or discomfort. 🤖
- This concept is particularly relevant in the context of generative AI video synthesis of emotional human faces. 📹

## The Challenge of Recreating Lifelike Faces
- Creating AI-generated faces that are both realistic and emotionally expressive is a significant challenge. 🤔
- Small imperfections in facial expressions, movements, or emotional nuances can make the synthesized faces appear strange or creepy to viewers. 👻

## The Impact on Emotional Intelligence
- The uncanny valley phenomenon can have a significant impact on the emotional intelligence of AI systems. 🤖
- If AI-generated faces are not convincingly realistic, they may not be able to evoke the desired emotional response from humans. 🤔

## What Do You Think?
- Can you think of any potential solutions to overcome the uncanny valley phenomenon in generative AI (face synthesis)? 💡
- Do you believe that the uncanny valley is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed in the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems? 🤔
