![Which Model](/img/blog_images/whichmodel.png)

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- GenAI for text implemented by LLMs
- Many open-source models available
- Continuous influx of new models
- Key foundation model families
- LLM-based GenAI pipelines at Comma Soft AG

## Background Information ‚öôÔ∏è

- GenAI for text can be implemented by LLMs
- LLMs are partially open-source available
- Day by day new models come to market or are published on platforms like Huggingface
- Many of them rely on certain Foundation model families
- Some of them exist in different sizes
- We @Comma Soft AG develop LLM based GenAI pipelines (sometimes using OS models like the ones in the survey)
