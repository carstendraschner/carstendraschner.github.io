**TL;DR ⏱️**
- Leveraging knowledge graphs for GenAI trends
- Identifying high-performing models and best practices
- Potential for a crowd-sourced GenAI cookbook

<!-- excerpt -->

Traversing the possible huge knowledge graph of evolving models... It would be interesting to see trends within this graph, such as which families and architectures are trending 📈. I'd love to explore over time what approaches for fine-tuning, datasets, or even the number of transformer layers/heads, etc. create high-performing and efficient models 🌱. So we could create a crowd-sourced best practice GenAI cookbook ❤️👩🏽‍🍳. Please let me know if you are already working on it Thomas Wolf 🤗
