An overview of the motivations and technical aspects behind developing our own GenAI solution, Alan, at Comma Soft AG.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- Diverse GenAI solutions exist
- Unique motivations for developing our own tool
- Technical advantages of our solution
- Questions on custom development vs. wrappers

<!-- excerpt -->

## Current Landscape: üèûÔ∏è

- There are a variety of GenAI solutions out there
- Many models from big tech companies work increasingly well for certain use cases.
- And we have launched our own solution. Why?

## Our technical perspective: ü§ì

- Data-Flow-Control: We want to know what happens to our data.
- Hosting: We host all our models and data on German servers.
- On-Premise: We can run our entire tech stack on-premise without any internet connection
- Our-own-Alan-Model: We optimize our models for dedicated use cases through further training (e.g., better language skills in GER)
- Knowledge-Enrichment: We decide for ourselves whether we want to make new knowledge available through our novel training approach or through our optimized RAG approach (as you might know there are plenty of options).
- Alignment: We have control over the alignment, i.e., to what extent the values and behaviors of the model match our expectations.
- SOTA: We always remain state of the art in a fusion of existing open source base models and in-house developments.
- Benchmarking: We use benchmarks and measures we trust.

With a great team at Comma Soft AG, it's enjoyable to develop such a helpful tool ‚ù§Ô∏è In the appended PDF we show an extract of the full text story of our ALAN development journey üìñ

## Questions: ü§î

- How did you decide if you want to develop something yourself or use more kind of wrappers?
- How important is the management of sensitive data for you and where are your servers located?
