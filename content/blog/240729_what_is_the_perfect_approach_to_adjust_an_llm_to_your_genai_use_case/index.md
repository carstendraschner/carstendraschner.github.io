Exploring various methods to customize LLMs for specific GenAI use cases, ranging from simple to complex approaches.

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- Various ways to customize LLMs for specific use cases
- Approaches vary in difficulty and complexity
- Pros and cons of different methods
- More dimensions to improve GenAI use cases

<!-- excerpt -->

## Key Considerations:

**Prompt Engineering & In-Context Learning:** Manually enriching the prompt with information to guide the model‚Äôs prediction into desired behavior.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Automatically retrieving context that is appended to the prompt on the fly after being retrieved through vector database similarity search and reranking.

**Parameter-Efficient Finetuning:** Training only a subset of the model's parameters while keeping others unchanged.

**Full Parameter Finetuning:** Training all parameters.

These approaches have pros and cons in terms of (and not limited to):
- Catastrophic Forgetting
- Memory Load
- Maximum Context-Size limits
- Hallucinations
- Response Time

There are also more approaches and dimensions to improve GenAI Use Cases like:
- Guardrails
- Structured output
and many more.

What are you working on, and which field are you interested in to see how we are working on it?

We at Comma Soft AG implement these and more approaches into our own Product Alan.de and support also other GenAI Use Cases through these approaches.
