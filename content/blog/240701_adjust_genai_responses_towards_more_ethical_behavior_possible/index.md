Exploring the potential and challenges of using system prompts to guide LLM behavior towards ethical outputs.

![Ethical AI](/img/blog_images/1719951079268.jpeg)

**TL;DR ‚è±Ô∏è**
- GenAI chat interactions often include system prompts
- System prompts aim to guide ethical LLM behavior
- Challenges exist in ensuring compliance and formulation
- Questions on designing and revealing system prompts

<!-- excerpt -->

## Background ü§ì

- GenAI is often used via chat
- We enter prompts in the Chat UI
- Under the hood, the Chat programs usually add a system prompt

## System-Prompt üí¨

- This system prompt should control the behavior of the LLM output
- The system prompt complements other behavioral optimizations such as alignment and other guardrails to improve ethical GenAI response
- The system prompt can describe behavior such as identity or desired behavior

## Problem ü•¥

- There is no guarantee to what extent the system prompt will be followed
- It is unclear what details should be included in the system prompt
- It is not possible to prevent the model from revealing the system prompt
- It is unclear how best to formulate the system prompt

## Questions ü§î

- How do you design system prompts, and what are yours?
- Do you think system prompts help to ensure the model's behavior?
- Do you think chat UIs should not reveal the system prompt and how would you achieve this?
