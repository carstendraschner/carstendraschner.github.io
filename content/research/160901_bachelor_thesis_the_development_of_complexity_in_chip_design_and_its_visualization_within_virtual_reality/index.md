<!-- excerpt -->

By dynamically loading detailed 3D models, we enable users to interactively explore and understand the intricate structures of chip designs without noticeable loading times. Our VR application provides an immersive experience, offering a more engaging and informative way to visualize chip designs compared to traditional 2D plots or 3D applications on a monitor. The integration of various views and tools enhances the user experience, providing valuable insights for both experts and non-experts. User testing with a diverse group of participants yielded overwhelmingly positive feedback, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. This project demonstrates the potential of VR technology in facilitating the understanding and exploration of complex technical designs, and contributes to the development of innovative applications in the field of chip design and visualization.
