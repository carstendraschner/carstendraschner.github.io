**TL;DR ⏱️**
- Distributed Explainable multi-modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs
- Reproducible, reusable, and explainable results
- SANSA stack integration

<!-- excerpt -->

We present the SimE4KG framework, which provides generic open-source modules for computing semantic similarity estimation in multi-modal KGs. SimE4KG delivers reproducible, reusable, and explainable results to justify the computing costs of similarity estimation. The pipeline outcomes are a native semantic RDF-KG, including the experiment results, hyper-parameter setup, and result explanation, as the most influential features. We utilized Apache Spark to develop a distributed strategy for efficient and scalable execution in memory. This framework's overall development is integrated into the SANSA distributed semantic analytics stack.
